Game-of-Life-Screen-Saver

A quick screensaver I made emulating Conway's Game of Life. Written in C, built for xscreensaver software. 

GameOfLife.c - the C code, and the only interesting file to look at here

GameOfLife - the compiled code into a program for xScreensaver to run. Look at link below for a guide or email me if you have any questions

vroot.h - a header file needed for xscreenprograms
